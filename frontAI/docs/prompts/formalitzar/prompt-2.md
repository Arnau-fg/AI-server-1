Response:

Com a desenvolupador de software, he tingut la sort d'immergir-me en un món de creativitat, llenguatge i resolució de problemes. Des que vaig escriure la primera línia de codi, he estat envoltat per un viatge emocionant i recompensador. Començar a programar als 16 anys en una classe escolar va ser el punt d'inflexió que m'ha portat fins aquí, on descobrir noves tecnologies i aprendre noves tècniques és la meva font de plaer i satisfacció.

Bon vocabulari, bona resposta
